Movie Recommendation System
About the Project
Ever struggled to decide what movie to watch next? This project solves that problem with a smart Movie Recommendation System that suggests movies tailored to your preferences. Whether youâ€™re into action-packed blockbusters, heartwarming dramas, or quirky indie films, this system has you covered!

What It Can Do

Personalized Suggestions: Get movie recommendations based on your tastes and interests.
Find Similar Movies: Loved a movie? Discover others like it using details like genre, cast, or director.
Crowd-Powered Picks: Leverages data from other users with similar preferences to recommend hidden gems.
Best of Both Worlds: Combines content-based and collaborative methods for accurate and diverse recommendations.
Movie Search: Quickly find info on any movie or explore by genre.

How It Works

Content-Based Filtering: Looks at the features of movies you like (genre, director, etc.) to suggest similar ones.
Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies based on ratings and preferences from users like you.
Hybrid Approach: Uses a mix of both techniques for even better recommendations.
